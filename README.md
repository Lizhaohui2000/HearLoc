Locating Unknown Sources in 3D with a Small-sized Microphone Array

We propose a indoor sound source localization system that can precisely localize . 

large cross wall array. The limit of the localization ability is equilent to the constructed virtual cross-wall array. 

. The structure of this work can be shown in:


Furthermore, we have investigate. More details can be found in our paper. 

The file structure is:
is the matlab code for .
is the matlab code for .
folder "python implement" is the python code for sound source localization in real time. Requirements: Raspberry Pi 3B+, Seeed Voice Card and Seeed Respeaker 4-Mic ULA. 

%This work has been submitted to IEEE transaction on Mobile Computing and is under review.
